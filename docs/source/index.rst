`ElegantRL <https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/ElegantRL>`_ is featured with lightweight, efficient and stable, for researchers and practitioners.

   - **Lightweight**: The core codes <1,000 lines, using PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, and NumPy.

   - **Efficient**: performance is comparable with Ray RLlib.

   - **Stable**: as stable as Stable Baseline 3.

Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms:

   - **DDPG, TD3, SAC, A2C, PPO(GAE) for continuous actions**
   
   - **DQN, DoubleDQN, D3QN for discrete actions**

For algorithm details, please check out OpenAI Spinning Up.
